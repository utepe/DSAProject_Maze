# Maze Generator and Solver
Data Structures & Algorithms Final Project

## Data Structures Used in Project
All Data Structures were coded by us: 
 - Stack: Used for maze generator DFS and maze solver DFS
 - Queue: Used in BFS solver
 - PriorityQueue: Used in Dijkstra's solver
 - ArrayList (List): Used in cell class for maze

## Algorithms Used in Project
 - Breadth First Search
 - Depth First Search
 - Recursive DFS
 - Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm
